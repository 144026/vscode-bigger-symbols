# Bigger Symbols

> NOTE: Incompatible with vscode 1.88+ (2024 March version)

Make class, function, methods, structure declarations appear larger.

## Acknowledgement

This extension draws heavily on alefragnani/vscode-separators, huge thanks.

## How does it work

CSS injection on `textDecoration`.

```typescript
let activeEditor = vscode.window.activeTextEditor;
const symbols = await commands.executeCommand('vscode.executeDocumentSymbolProvider', activeEditor);
const decoType = window.createTextEditorDecorationType({ textDecoration: `;font-size:120%` });
activeEditor.setDecorations(decoType, symbols.forEach(s => s.selectionRange));
```

> NOTE: `font-size` css injection no longer works since vscode 1.88+, probably after this commit:

```

Other plugins relying on css injection have seen similar reports:

## Limitations

1. Text decoration gets cleared when active editor gets switched.
2. Line height cannot be variant, symbols looks squashed if font size gets too big: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/131274
3. Currently only symbols from outline view are used. SemanticTokens stream maybe better, but not looked into. (getting full token
stream every time is too slow, and don't know how to filter out non-declaration tokens yet).
